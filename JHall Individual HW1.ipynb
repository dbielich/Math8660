    "Firstly, if $f \\notin L^q(\\Omega)$ for $q \\geq 1$ then $\\int_\\Omega |f|^qdx$ is not finite. The theorem in the problem statement implies a special embedding of $L^p$ spaces within one another under certain circumanstances. For a brief discussion, we illustrate an embedding guaranteed by the given theorem in a concrete example. Let $\\Omega=(0,1)\\subset \\mathbb{R}$, so $\\mu(\\Omega)=1<\\infty$ meaning $\\Omega$ has finite measure, satisfying the assumptions in the given theorem. Let $f(x)=x^{-1/4}$. Now we recall a Calculus result which we shall need momentarily (and in a few of the arguments in (a.) and (b).): $$ \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{x^p}dx<\\infty \\iff p<1.$$ This immediately gives us $\\int_\\Omega |f|^q dx<\\infty$ as long as $q=1, 2,$ or $3$; hence $f \\in L^1(\\Omega)$, $f \\in L^2(\\Omega)$, and $f \\in L^3(\\Omega)$. Notice that $q=4$ is a sort of tipping point; indeed, with $q=4$ we have $\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{x}dx$ which is classically known to diverge, and is exactly when the power $p$ appearing in $\\frac{1}{x^p}$ exceeds $1$ in our Calculus result we recalled above. In other words, $f \\notin L^4(\\Omega)$; in fact, $f \\notin L^p(\\Omega)$, $p \\geq 4.$ The embedding theorem is clearly obeyed here: because $\\int_\\Omega |f|^3dx<\\infty$, $f\\in L^3(\\Omega)$ and our theorem implies that $L^2(\\Omega)\\subset L^3(\\Omega)$ and $L^1(\\Omega)\\subset L^3(\\Omega)$, so $f\\in L^2(\\Omega)$ and $f\\in L^1(\\Omega)$. The theorem guarantees nothing about $f \\in L^p(\\Omega)$ for powers $p$ exceeding $3$, the power we originally made a claim about."
